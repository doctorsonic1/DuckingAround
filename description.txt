Just ducking around... (this mod is purely for experimentation)

Recent Changes:
v0.6.0
- Enemy spawner NPC now works on multiplayer
	- Certain enemies have a chance to drop a spawn egg
		- Having spawn egg in your inventory makes spawner spawn that specific enemy
		- Having multiple eggs in your inventory will only spawn enemies of one type
	- Using the spawn item with the NPC already active moves the NPC to the players location
- Psion boss spawn recipe change
- Psion boss spawns less ore, but spawns it every time it's killed

        - Drops machine parts

    - It's a hoverboard that moves really fast
